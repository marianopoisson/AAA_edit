\section{Multipurpose Interferometric Array, the big picture}
\label{sec:intro}
Interferometry is a method of observing celestial sources based on the principle of wave interference, where radio signals picked up by multiple antennas are combined and processed to form detailed images of astronomical sources. By adding or subtracting the signals in phase, interference patterns can be obtained that reveal information about the structure and location of the observed sources.

The Multipurpose Interferometric Array (MIA) is a groundbreaking radio astronomical instrument in South America, designed to offer high angular resolution in the 21 cm band. By using interferometric techniques, where signals from multiple antennas are combined to synthesize a single, high-resolution astronomical image, MIA aims to enhance scientific research capabilities at the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy, fostering international collaboration and advancing expertise in interferometry within Argentina.

Initially a low-cost setup, MIA will grow with time in different phases. Phase-0 will be a pathfinder built at IAR to prove the technology. Phase-1 will consist of 16 antennas, and consecutive phases could potentially grow up to 64 antennas. All the antennas are linked to a central processing unit for data analysis. Its high sensitivity enables precise detection of faint radio sources across a frequency range of 1 GHz to 2.3 GHz, facilitating diverse scientific investigations including transient phenomena, pulsar timing, and X-ray binary studies.

MIA's broad scientific potential encompasses research on gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, magnetar flares, and unidentified gamma-ray sources. It also enables studies on active galactic nuclei variability, supernova remnants morphology, and cosmological HI line observations, offering insights into the reionization epoch and interstellar medium dynamics.

Furthermore, MIA supports investigations into ionized hydrogen regions, OH maser variability in star-forming regions, and extended star-forming regions, shedding light on their dynamics and physical characteristics. Collaborative ventures with international observatories are facilitated, leveraging MIA's sensitivity and unique South American location to enrich astrophysical research both locally and globally, thus contributing to our understanding of the Universe.

\section{Road to Construction and Financial Support}
\label{sec:construction}

The MIA project is strategically designed to be cost-effective, leveraging local manufacturing and assembly to support the regional economy and create employment opportunities. Collaboration with international partners is sought to secure financial backing for various project phases, including antenna construction, central node installation, and data processing systems, ensuring project success and sustainability.

Local institutions are invited to participate, particularly in site selection, to ensure optimal interferometer functionality by considering factors like accessibility, existing infrastructure, and radio interference. Lessons learned from previous projects and similar instruments such as the Deep Synoptic Array 110 (DSA-110) and the Karoo Array Telescope (KAT-7) have been incorporated, tailoring systems specifically for MIA while addressing project-specific requirements and characteristics.

The technical summary of the MIA project includes a total of 16 antennas for Phase 1, each with a diameter of 5 m and an alt-azimuth mount. The minimum baseline for the antennas is approximately 50 meters, while the maximum baseline is 55 km. The interferometer has a minimum angular resolution of 1.5 arcsec at 1420 MHz / 50 km and a receiver temperature of less than 50 K.

The MIA project operates in the frequency range of 1 to 2.3 GHz and digitizes the signals received in each antenna. The final bandwidth of the system is 1000 MHz and the correlation of the signals takes place in a central node. In addition, the interferometer has the capability to add antennas to both the central core and the external antennas, allowing for future expansion and development of the system.

The full technical summary is presented below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of antennas for Phase 1: 16.
    \item Diameter of each antenna = 5 m (with alt-azimuth mount).
    \item Minimum baseline = 50 m.
    \item Maximum baseline = 55 km.
    \item Minimum angular resolution = 1.5 arcsec at 1420 MHz / 50 km.
    \item Receiver temperature = 65K.
    \item Operating frequency = 1 to 2.3 GHz.
    \item Digitization in each antenna.
    \item Final bandwidth of 1000 MHz.
    \item Correlation in a central node.
    \item Ability to add antennas both to the central node and beyond the external antennas.
\end{itemize}

\section{Short term plan}
\label{sec:plan}


The short-term plan for the MIA project, which is currently underway, is to design and build a pathfinder instrument consisting of three antennas to be installed in the IAR, with multiple objectives as a technology demonstrator, human resource training, and scientific data validation. The primary goal is to develop the technical skills necessary to build a larger interferometer, which will include the development and testing of interferometric observing techniques and the creation of data acquisition and processing programs.

 For the Pathfinder we applied the same kind of simulation to understand their response using a 100~m baseline; Fig.~\ref{fig:mia3sim} shows the results of the simulation while  Fig.~\ref{fig:mia3site} shows the proposed location of the elements to be installed at IAR.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{mia_3_site_2.jpg}
  \caption{\emph{Proposed location for Pathfinder antennas within the IAR.}}
  \label{fig:mia3site}
\end{figure}


The short-term plan for MIA includes training new technical and scientific talent through university internships, graduate theses, and Ph.D. programs in engineering and astronomy. This initiative aims to cultivate skilled professionals who can contribute to the project's success and future expansion.

Scientifically, the short-term objective is to validate the data collected by the MIA interferometer, emphasizing reproducibility and verification by the scientific community.

Funding for the Pathfinder project is secured through CONICET-PUE\footnote{\url{https://convocatorias.conicet.gov.ar/proyectos-de-investigacion-de-ue-conicet/}} program for research centers, primarily allocated for the development of the complete system, including antennas, front-end and back-end systems, digitizers, and processing units.

Key requirements for MIA Pathfinder involve designing and constructing the antenna structure at the IAR, featuring a 5 m parabolic dish with Alt-Azimuth movements. Front-end and back-end systems, designed and built at the IAR, operate within a frequency range of 1 GHz to 2 GHz, with linear polarization and RF link via analog fiber optic.

Digitizers and processing systems utilize CASPER tools, employing SNAP boards with a total bandwidth of 1500 MHz across three antennas and two polarizations. Data processing involves CPU/GPU systems, with transmission facilitated over a 10 Gbps network.

The personnel involved in the MIA Pathfinder project include a Ph.D. student for antenna distribution and optimization, IAR technical staff for electronics, mechanics, IT, and Electronic Engineering students from the La Plata National University, whose thesis on related topics such as RF systems, digitizers, and correlation, with the aid of scientific researchers.

\section{Current Status}
\label{sec:status}
The MIA project has made significant progress up to its current state, and included several critical components in the design, test, and integration process. Especially, in the design of its radio frequency front-end, which is currently being tested for functionality and integration with the telemetry electronics. This front-end design is a critical component of the MIA-Phase 1 signal processing chain as it receives incoming signals from the 16 antennas and converts them to digital signals for processing. The antenna feed is designed as a board antenna called Vivaldi, which has two linear polarizations. The RF stages consist of low noise amplifiers and bandwidth limiting filters and the RFoF modules, all designed, integrated and tested at the IAR.

Figure~\ref{fig:antcai} shows the Vivaldi antenna being tested in the IAR anechoic chamber.

  \caption{\emph{Measurement of the Vivaldi antenna at IAR anechoic chamber (2023).}}
  \label{fig:antcai}
\end{figure}

The MIA project has reached a major milestone with the construction of the first 5-m parabolic dish. This task represents a significant step forward in the development of the Pathfinder. The technical staff has used its expertise to design the antenna structure and perform simulations using CAD models. The results of these simulations were used to guide the construction phase Fig.~\ref{fig:complete}. In addition, the mount and support structure for the dish are currently under development. An alt-azimuth mount has been incorporated into the dish design to allow precise pointing and tracking of astronomical sources. The project is focused on developing and perfecting the control systems for the dish to ensure optimal performance.

The digitizer unit is pivotal to both the MIA system and its Pathfinder, facilitating the acquisition and processing of astronomical data. It functions by converting analog signals from antennas into digital format for correlation. Utilizing a SNAP CASPER board, featuring a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), enables real-time digital signal processing with high data throughput.

Programmable via CASPER toolflow, the FPGA executes custom signal processing algorithms tailored to MIA's requirements. Operating within a bandwidth of 1500 MHz across three antennas and two polarizations, the digitizer transmits data over a 10 Gbps network to the correlator for image production.

Efforts are directed towards optimizing the digitizer's performance by refining CASPER firmware and FPGA resource allocation to enhance processing speed and minimize power consumption. Additionally, software tools are under development to analyze acquired data, identifying and mitigating noise or interference. Overall, the digitizer unit is integral to the success of the MIA system.

\end{figure}

\section{Future development}
Once the design has been validated, it is planned to continue with the development of the 16 antenna MIA (MIA-16). A site selection campaign is planned for MIA-16. The campaign will involve a general survey of the site, such as existing infrastructure, power lines, access, etc. In addition, measurements of electromagnetic interference at the frequency of interest will be carried out with portable equipment. The development of this project is of great importance and strategic for the development of radio astronomy in Argentina. Thus, it is possible to achieve remarkable scientific-technological results.
