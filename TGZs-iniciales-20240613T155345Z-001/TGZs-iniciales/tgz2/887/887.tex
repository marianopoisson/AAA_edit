En combinación con los paquetes de análisis pyUPMASK y ASteCA, los datos \textit{Gaia} proveen probabilidad de membresía, parámetros estructurales y fundamentales de tres cúmulos abiertos, NGC 2659, UBC 482 y UBC 246 ya encontrados en este lugar. Hallamos que dos de ellos, NGC 2659 y UBC 246, están superpuestos a lo largo de la línea de visión y separados entre si casi 100 pc. Esto confirma reportes previos sobre su existencia, siendo el más evidente el cúmulo joven NGC 2659 mientras el otro, UBC 246, es un objeto relativamente débil y más viejo. También investigamos la verdadera naturaleza del sistema binario compuesto por NGC 2659 y UBC 482.}

\abstract{We present and discuss data coming from the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 mission up to $G = 21$ mag in two stellar fields covering about 5 square degrees in the area of the open cluster NGC 2659 in the region of Vela. In combination with the pyUPMASK and ASteCA analysis packages,\textit{Gaia} data provide membership probabilities, structure and fundamental parameters of three open clusters, NGC 2659, UBC 482 and UBC 246 already found in this place. We found that two of them, NGC 2659 and UBC 246, are superposed along the line of sight and separated by about 100 pc. This confirms previous reports about their existence, the more evident being the young group NGC 2659 while the other, UBC 246, is a relatively faint and older object. We also investigated the true nature of the binary system composed by NGC 2659 and UBC 482.}

\section{Introduction}\label{S_intro}

In a recent work \cite{Giorgi2023BAAA...64...90G} investigated partially the area of the open clusters NGC 2659 and of Pismis 9, both superposed along the line of sight. However, new research in the region of NGC 2659 has concluded that this cluster forms part of a probable binary system with UBC 246 \citep{Castro-Ginard2020A&A...635A..45C}. Contrarily, \cite{Song2022A&A...666A..75S} assigned a different partner to NGC 2659 named UBC 482, which was reported by \cite{Casado2021ARep...65..755C} as member of a physical pair with NGC 2659 as well. Casado applied a rule that groups clusters according to their mutual distances and range of ages. Similar criterion was applied by other authors to detect binary cluster but including radial velocities too \citep{Subramaniam1995A&A...302...86S, Song2022A&A...666A..75S}.Based on the mutual distance between NGC 2659 and UBC 482, Casado claims that both clusters constitute a physical pair. Casado also claims that NGC 2659 belongs to group No 18 on his list containing clusters in this same region at similar distances from the Sun.

The present work is aimed at establishing a more trustable frequency of binary clusters in our Galaxy. This number is poorly known  because most open clusters are located along the Galactic plane where the presence of dust makes it difficult to accurately estimate the distances of each component in any potential physical pair.  Uncertainties in ages, distances and absorption often worsen due to the increasing errors amongst the faintest stars and observational data limits. Therefore, extensive and high-precision data provided by the \textit{Gaia} DR3 mission -from now on \textit{Gaia}- \citep{2023vallenari} down to G $\sim$ 21, offer a great opportunity to elucidate the true nature of assumed binary clusters in the Milky Way.

\section{Data and analysis tools}

\textit{Gaia} data such as position, parallax, proper motions, $G$ magnitudes and color index $BP-RP$ were used in our investigation. Two areas were considered for our analysis: the first one centered around the NGC 2659 position enclosed by a small red box 1$^{\circ}$ on a side including more than $25\,000$ stars with \textit{Gaia} data. The second region is centered on the coordinates given for UBC 482 and is delimited by a red square of 2$^{\circ}$ on a side as shown in Fig. \ref{Figura1}. Areas this big are necessary to get an adequate sample of the cluster surroundings.  In the same figure the small box (1$5^{\prime}\times15^{\prime}$) in green shows approximately the region studied in the past by \cite{Corti2007A&A...467..137C} that we will discuss later on. Notice that there exists some overlapping between the red boxes. The presence of dust and gas all over the surveyed region is easily noted in the figure, particularly in the position of NGC 2659. These two regions were inspected using the codes pyUPMASK \citep{Pera2021A&A...650A.109P} and ASteCA \citep{Perren2015A&A...576A...6P} which our group developed. The first code has been designed to assign membership probabilities to cluster stars observed in a frame contaminated by field stars. The second is intended to get the parameters of each group (distances, ages and sizes).

\subsection{The star groups}

Figure \ref{Figura2} shows the results after applying pyUPMASK in the region. The process yielded three stellar groups already shown in Fig. \ref{Figura1}, NGC 2659 (blue circles), UBC 246 (yellow circles) and UBC 482 (green circles). The spatial distribution of the potential members with probability above $70\%$ shows that NGC 2659 and UBC 246 are strongly concentrated while those of UBC 482 are not. UBC 246 has a number of peripheral members spanning a large area. Likewise, the proper motion diagram (pmRA and pmDE are right ascension and declination, respectively) of the zone (left panel in Fig. \ref{Figura3}) indicates that NGC 2659 and UBC 482 share the same pmRA with a slight difference in pmDE. That is, these two objects share the same state of motion, quite different from that of UBC 246. The distribution of individual parallaxes in the right panel of Fig. \ref{Figura3} shows a similar distance for UBC 482 and NGC 2659 and a slightly greater value for the UBC 246 group. Notice -within the uncertainties of the values- that the distributions of parallaxes in the UBC 482 and UBC 246 groups, 0.30 mas and 0.27 mas, respectively, are broader than the one of NGC 2659, 0.19 mas. Since NGC 2659 is a small cluster and, moreover, superimposed to UBC 246, the confusion between their members only could be clarified with proper motions.
 
Whatever the analysis strategy used to get the most trustable membership in each group, still they must be analyzed individually to see whether their color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) are the ones expected for open clusters. To do this, potential members of each of these groups were analyzed next with ASteCA; the respective parameters are listed in Table 1 while the appearance of the CMDs obtained with ASteCA are depicted in Fig. \ref{Figura4}. Here, NGC 2659 and UBC 246 have the expected CMDs for open clusters according to their ages. Moreover, both have well-defined main sequences extending over eight magnitudes. In the case of UBC 246, the top of its sequence is well-delimited and components of the giant branch, compatible with the age assigned by ASteCA, are seen. The conclusion is that these two star groups are real open clusters. Contrarily, the CMD of UBC 482 is complex since it appears as a young object with a confused main sequence where the few brighter members above $G = 14$ mag are fully scattered. Below that value, the main sequence shows a slight widening. We will discuss these facts in the next section.

\section{ The alleged physical pair UBC 482 and NGC 2659}

Reviewing the literature, we found that UBC 482 coincides with the position of the potential cluster, Bochum 7, already revisited by \cite{Sung1999JKAS...32..109S}, \cite{Corti2003A&A...405..571C} and by \cite{Corti2007A&A...467..137C}. So, the existence of Bochum 7 has been known for many years \citep{Moffat1975A&AS...20...85M}. Sung et al. identified two stellar components, one is the association Vela OB1 with a mean distance of $\sim$ $1\,800$ pc and the other is the association Vela OB3 at an average distance of $4\,800$ pc. For these authors, Bochum 7 is a stellar group in Vela OB3. \cite{Corti2007A&A...467..137C} carried out a spectroscopic survey for more than 60 young stars confirming that two associations of very young objects superimposed along the line of sight are seen. They concluded that Bochum 7 is not an open cluster but the farthest portion of a very young stellar continuum that extends for several thousand parsecs. \cite{Corti2007A&A...467..137C} computed individual distance moduli according to colors, absorption and spectral types of these young stars. This way of estimating distances can lead to large errors between early-type stars due to calibration and reddening uncertainties. But what really matters in the present case is not the distance value of each star but the dispersion that the set of them shows. We estimated individual distances of the same stars through the inversion of their \textit{Gaia} parallaxes. We know this method is entirely naïve but again, what matters to us is the dispersion level and correlation of distances of these stars derived by a method completely independent of the previous one.

\label{Figura5}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Figura5} shows spectrophotometric distances obtained by \cite{Corti2007A&A...467..137C} vs. distances obtained through \textit{Gaia} parallaxes. These early-type stars range from $1\,000$ to $7\,000$ pc in the spectrophotometric case and from $1\,000$ to $8\,000$ pc in the case of parallaxes with similar dispersions around the identity line. Fig. \ref{Figura5} confirms that the region of UBC 482 does not contain an open cluster but rather two associations, Vela OB1 and Vela OB3. These associations seem to separate from each other at about $4\,000$ pc from the sun (see the large grey plus sign). Therefore, we must accept that two star groups compose the region of UBC 482/Bochum 7 and that none of them is an open cluster given their huge radial distribution. These facts are against the idea of a binary association between NGC 2659 and UBC 482 since the last one is just a handful of early-type stars belonging to Vela OB1 and Vela OB3. Some members of Vela OB1 are located at almost the same distance and share a same proper motion with the real cluster NGC 2659. And it is only by this fact that they have similar proper motions. New \textit{Gaia} radial velocities are needed to investigate the entire group and adequately explain how we can see similar proper motions maintained for over $6\,000$ pc. To the same extent, the proper motion of UBC 246 should be investigated apart since its movement is completely different from the rest. There is a possibility that UBC 246 is associated with a different stellar current that intersects that of Vela OB1 and Vela OB3. This is quite characteristic of associations. As an example, Vela OB2, at a distance of about 400 pc and almost 6 degrees south of the region studied in this case, was studied by \cite{Armstrong2022MNRAS.517.5704A} who found different kinematic groups that would form in star subgroups dispersed from their initial concentrations in open clusters. 

\subsection{ Concluding remarks}

 From our analysis of \textit{Gaia} data using our own codes in 5 square degrees in the area of NGC 2659, we found three well spatially defined stellar groups. Two of them correspond to true open clusters, NGC 2659 and UBC 246. The first is very young while the second is much older. NGC 2659 is located ahead of UBC 246 separated along the line of sight by just 100 parsecs. UBC 482, which has been considered member of a binary system along with NGC 2659, is not a cluster but the superposition of young stars for more than $6\,000$ pc that, in turn, are scattered members of two associations, Vela OB1 and Vela OB3, reported previously. Consequently there is no possibility that NGC 2659 and UBC 482 form a physical pair despite their proximity and similar age. NGC 2659 appears here as a member of Vela OB1. A final comment: the treatment of massive data that ignores information stored in the literature can lead to wrong statistics.
