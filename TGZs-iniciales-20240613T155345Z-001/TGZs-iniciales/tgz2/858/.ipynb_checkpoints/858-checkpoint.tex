This cataclysmic variable belongs to the intermediate polar class, with an spin period of $\sim$501 seconds and orbital period of 0.1529 days. During TESS observations of Sector 40, the orbital period of 0.1529(1) days is detected significantly 17 days after the onset of the outburst. A modulation of unknown origin with a period of $\sim$0.537 days is present in the data from day 13 to day 17.

V1674~Her (Nova Her 2021) was reported in an outburst on 2021 June 12.537 UT at 8.4 magnitudes by Seiji Ueda (Kushiro, Hokkaido, Japan) reaching naked-eye magnitudes at its peak (\citealt{2021ATel14704....1M,2022ATel15796....1M} and other references in \citealt{2021ApJ...922L..42D}). Early X-ray observations obtained with {\em Chandra}  \citep{2000SPIE.4012....2W} show an strong modulation with a period of 503.9 s \citep{2021ATel14776....1M}. A period of 501.42~s was later reported by \cite{2021ATel14720....1M} found in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$-band data obtained during quiescence. These were the first hints of the presence of a magnetic-accreting white dwarf in the system. The period measurement was refined and confirmed in subsequent X-ray monitoring \citep{2021ATel14798....1P, 2021ApJ...922L..42D, Orio2022} and was clearly detected during all the supersoft X-ray phase \citep{Orio2022}.

Early X-ray observations obtained with {\em Chandra}  \citep{2000SPIE.4012....2W} show an strong modulation with a period of 503.9 s \citep{2021ATel14776....1M}. A period of 501.42~s was later reported by \cite{2021ATel14720....1M} found in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$-band data obtained during quiescence. These were the first hints of the presence of a magnetic-accreting white dwarf in the system. The period measurement was refined and confirmed in subsequent X-ray monitoring \citep{2021ATel14798....1P, 2021ApJ...922L..42D, Orio2022} and was clearly detected during all the supersoft X-ray phase \citep{Orio2022}. 


Photometric data obtained by \cite{2021ATel14835....1S} and \cite{2021ATel14856....1P} allowed the detection of a 0.15302(2)~days period in optical wavelengths. This has since been identified as the orbital period. Then, V1674~Her has the physical characteristics to be identified as a magnetic cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar type; a binary system where the white dwarf's magnetic field ($\approx$0.1–10 MG) channels material from the inner edge of the truncated accretion

In this article, we analyze the photometric series obtained with the TESS \citep{2015JATIS...1a4003R} mission during the scanning of sector 40. The exquisite quality and cadence allow us to search for the orbital period during the decaying phase of a nova. This modulation, observed in fast novae once they fade for about 2-4 magnitudes after outbursts, arise from irradiation of the secondary and/or ellipsoidal variations.

V1674~Her was observed with TESS during Sector 40, which started on June 25 2021, 12.62 days after the outburst. The total observing time was 676~h. Figure~\ref{Fig:lc}a shows the TESS light curve in the context of the post-outburst light curve from AAVSO (Fig.~\ref{Fig:lc}b). We extracted the TESS Full Frame Images (FFI) with a cadence of 10~min using {\tt TESSCut} tool \citep{Brasseur_2019} from the Python package {\tt lightkurve} \citep{Lightkurve_2018}.

We searched for periods using the Lomb-Scargle \citep{1976Ap&SS..39..447L,1982ApJ...263..835S} algorithm in the light curve with the SG filter applied (Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}e).

The TESS light curve of V1674~Her from day 17 after the outburst is modulated at the orbital period of P$_{orb}$=0.1529(1) days, consistent with previous findings. The light curve folded at the orbital period and taking the ephemeris, T$_{0}$, from \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P}, shows a double-peak profile (see Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}g), with secondary minima distant at

Although the observations started 13 days after the outburst, remarkably, the orbital period was not detected until $\sim$17 days after the outburst, also in agreement with \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P}.

We found that within the error of 0.001 days, we could not detect any changes in the orbital period during the 28.2 days covered by TESS. \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P} report a systematic drift toward longer periods in the photometric data taken in 2022 with respect to those taken in 2021. Our observations do not cover the times when the source has returned to quiescence, when the changes in the orbital period seem to manifests.

The variability on time scales longer than the orbital period reported by \citet{2023MNRAS.521.5453S} is also observed in the TESS light curve from day 13th until day 17th. A search for periods in this segment of the light curve yields a period of $\sim$0.537 days, of unknown origin (see Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}h). This period is unlikely to be due to superhumps, which are modulations with periods slightly below or above the orbital period and likely due to a warped/precessing accretion disk. The 0.537 days period is much longer than the orbital period.

\section{Conclusion}
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
\label{sec:conc}


We analyzed the TESS, observations of Nova Her 2021, that entered into Sector 40 12.62 days after being reported to be in outburst. This nova belongs to the intermediate polar class of cataclysmic variables and, as such, it displays clear modulations with the orbital and white dwarf spin periods. In agreement with other authors, we found that the light curve shows two minima, separated by half a cycle. The secondary minimum is most noticeable once the light curve is decaying more slowly and the systems is reaching quiescence conditions. This secondary minimum could be due to the eclipsed, enhanced emission due to irradiation of the secondary by the still-burning white dwarf \citep{2022ApJ...924...27P}.

V1674~Her (Nova Her 2021) was reported in an outburst on 2021 June 12.537 UT at 8.4 magnitudes by Seiji Ueda (Kushiro, Hokkaido, Japan) reaching naked-eye magnitudes at its peak (\citealt{2021ATel14704....1M,2022ATel15796....1M} and other references in \citealt{2021ApJ...922L..42D}). Early X-ray observations obtained with {\em Chandra}  \citep{2000SPIE.4012....2W} show an strong modulation with a period of 503.9 s \citep{2021ATel14776....1M}. A period of 501.42~s was later reported by \cite{2021ATel14720....1M} found in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$-band data obtained during quiescence. These were the first hints of the presence of a magnetic-accreting white dwarf in the system. The period measurement was refined and confirmed in subsequent X-ray monitoring \citep{2021ATel14798....1P, 2021ApJ...922L..42D, Orio2022} and was clearly detected during all the supersoft X-ray phase \citep{Orio2022}.

Photometric data obtained by \cite{2021ATel14835....1S} and \cite{2021ATel14856....1P} allowed the detection of a 0.15302(2)~days period in optical wavelengths. This has since been identified as the orbital period.

In this article, we analyze the photometric series obtained with the TESS \citep{2015JATIS...1a4003R} mission during the scanning of sector 40. The exquisite quality and cadence allow us to search for the orbital period during the decaying phase of a nova. This modulation, observed in fast novae once they fade for about 2-4 magnitudes after outbursts, arise from irradiation of the secondary and/or ellipsoidal variations.

V1674~Her was observed with TESS during Sector 40, which started on June 25 2021, 12.62 days after the outburst. The total observing time was 676~h. Figure~\ref{Fig:lc}a shows the TESS light curve in the context of the post-outburst light curve from AAVSO (Fig.~\ref{Fig:lc}b). We extracted the TESS Full Frame Images (FFI) with a cadence of 10~min using {\tt TESSCut} tool \citep{Brasseur_2019} from the Python package {\tt lightkurve} \citep{Lightkurve_2018}.

We searched for periods using the Lomb-Scargle \citep{1976Ap&SS..39..447L,1982ApJ...263..835S} algorithm in the light curve with the SG filter applied (Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}e). We also searched for changes in the orbital period by extracting the power spectrum in 3-days-long sliding windows that overlap 50\% (Figure \ref{Fig:lc}d,f).

The TESS light curve of V1674~Her from day 17 after the outburst is modulated at the orbital period of P$_{orb}$=0.1529(1) days, consistent with previous findings. The light curve folded at the orbital period and taking the ephemeris, T$_{0}$, from \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P}, shows a double-peak profile (see Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}g), with secondary minima distant at

Although the observations started 13 days after the outburst, remarkably, the orbital period was not detected until $\sim$17 days after the outburst, also in agreement with \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P}.

We found that within the error of 0.001 days, we could not detect any changes in the orbital period during the 28.2 days covered by TESS. \citet{2022ApJ...940L..56P} report a systematic drift toward longer periods in the photometric data taken in 2022 with respect to those taken in 2021. Our observations do not cover the times when the source has returned to quiescence, when the changes in the orbital period seem to manifests.

The variability on time scales longer than the orbital period reported by \citet{2023MNRAS.521.5453S} is also observed in the TESS light curve from day 13th until day 17th. A search for periods in this segment of the light curve yields a period of $\sim$0.537 days, of unknown origin (see Fig. \ref{Fig:lc}h). This period is unlikely to be due to superhumps, which are modulations with periods slightly below or above the orbital period and likely due to a warped/precessing accretion disk. The 0.537 days period is much longer than the orbital period.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
\label{sec:conc}


We analyzed the TESS, observations of Nova Her 2021, that entered into Sector 40 12.62 days after being reported to be in outburst. This nova belongs to the intermediate polar class of cataclysmic variables and, as such, it displays clear modulations with the orbital and white dwarf spin periods. In agreement with other authors, we found that the light curve shows two minima, separated by half a cycle. The secondary minimum is most noticeable once the light curve is decaying more slowly and the systems is reaching quiescence conditions. This secondary minimum could be due to the eclipsed, enhanced emission due to irradiation of the secondary by the still-burning white dwarf \citep{2022ApJ...924...27P}.
