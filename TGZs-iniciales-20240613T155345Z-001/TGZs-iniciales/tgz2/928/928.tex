\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{yor00} has represented a turning point for modern astronomy,
which is entering an era dominated by large surveys. In particular, photometric multi-band 
surveys, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope \citep{ive08} or the Javalambre Photometric 
Local Universe Survey \citep[J-PLUS,][]{cen19}, provide useful data for a large variety of 
astronomical topics with low telescope time. The amount of data released by these surveys allows 
homogeneous studies of large samples of targets, but it also leads to challenges when processing
the data that have to be addressed in an automated manner.

In particular, the study of globular clusters (GCs) in nearby galaxies is relevant for our 
knowledge of galaxy evolution. They are present in the majority of the galaxies with masses 
above $\approx 10^9\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, spanning different morphologies and environments
\citep[e.g.][]{har15}. The formation and later evolution of GCs, as well as the build-up of 
globular cluster systems (GCSs), are related to the mergers experienced by their host 
galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{kru19,li19}, and their properties provide evidences about the host
galaxy, including the amount of dark matter \citep[e.g.][]{hud14,for18}, the relevance of the 
accretion processes \citep[e.g.][]{deb22}, and the mechanisms that rule the disruptions of
substructure in the inner regions \citep[e.g.][]{cas24}.
This article presents preliminary results from a project devoted to the study of the GCSs
in nearby spirals, through observations from J-PLUS, and continues the 
analysis carried by \citet{chi22} and \citet{cas23} of the M\,81 triplet, chosen as a test 
bench for our project. Its distance \citep[$D\approx 3.6$\,Mpc,][]{tul13}, and the existence 
of previous studies on the GCSs of M\,81 \citep{per95,nan10,nan11,ma17} make it an excellent
target for our purposes. The triplet is conformed by the spiral M\,81, the dominant galaxy in 
the group, the starburst spiral M\,82 and the irregular NGC\,3077. There is evidence of 
interactions, including emission in HI \citep{deb18} and low surface-brightness substructure 
in optical bands \citep{sme20} that seems to connect the galaxies. 

\section{Observations and photometry}

The dataset is conformed by processed images in twelve filters, from $u$ to $z$ (see 
\citealt{cen19} for information about the filters system) for three pointings that cover 
the entire region of the triplet, and span to the South. The images are publicly available 
at the J-PLUS collaboration website\footnote{http://www.j-plus.es/datareleases/data\_release\_dr2}.

  sources and its stellarity index are obtained from the composite image described in 
  Section\,\ref{sec.phot}. The {\it right panel} is analogue, but the detection and 
  stellarity index are based on the $r$ image. The red circles correspond to sources with 
  proper motions larger than 3 m.a.s. per year, from Gaia DR3, and assumed as Galactic 
  stars. The green triangles correspond to confirmed GCs from the literature.}
  \label{Fig1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Photometry}
\label{sec.phot}
  In order to increase the signal-to-noise for faint sources, we perform the 
  detection on a composite image, built from the addition of the images 
  corresponding to broad bands $g$, $r$, $i$ and $z$, plus the narrow band 
  images from filters $J0515$,  $J0660$ and $J0861$. Bluer filters are not
  used to build the composite image, since the spectral energy distribution for old GCs drops in flux for wavelengths below 
  $5000\,{\rm \AA}$ \citep[e.g.][]{bro06}. The aperture photometry in the 
  twelve filters is carried using 
  S{\sc ource}E{\sc xtractor} \citep{ber96} in dual mode, with the composite
  image as the reference one, and using a Gaussian filter to classify the 
  sources. The background is measured locally, with a mesh size of 32 pixels, 
  large enough to not affect the photometry. Typically, the mean effective radii 
  of extragalactic GCs is $\approx 3-4$\,pc \citep[e.g.][]{pen08,cas14}. 
  Considering the distance to the triplet and the typical seeing in these 
  images (above 1\,arcsec), GCs can be treated as point-sources. Finally, a 
  selection of point sources is made based on the S{\sc ource}E{\sc xtractor} 
  parameters, ${\rm FWHM}$ and stellarity index, obtained from the composite
  image. This procedure allows us to reach fainter magnitudes, and to improve
  the selection of sources (see Fig.\,\ref{Fig1}). Point sources lacking 
  photometric measurements in more than one filter are excluded, as well as
  those presenting uncertainties above 0.5\,mag in the broad bands (except for
  the $u$ filter). Finally, the definite catalogue is matched with Gaia\,DR3 
  \citep{gai21} to add information on proper motions.
  
\subsection{Photometric corrections}
  The zero points for each filter are calculated from the crossmatch of the 
  point sources with the J-PLUS photometric catalogue, for the corresponding
  aperture radius. Besides, aperture corrections are obtained from several 
  bright and isolated stars in different sections of the fields. In contrast
  to what was performed in \citet{chi22}, the extinction corrections are 
  calculated for each source with a $E_{B-V}$ map built from the extinction 
  calculators of the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science 
Archive\footnote{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/},
  and used to correct the photometry of the extinction coefficients 
  for the J-PLUS filters from \citet{lop19}. Figure\,\ref{Fig2} shows
  the map with the gradient of colours representing increasing values of 
  reddening, from 0.04\,mag (light yellow) to 0.14\,mag (dark blue). It 
  should be emphasised that sources embedded in the disk of both spirals 
  could still be affected by their intrinsic extinction.

  this analysis. It is built from the extinction calculators from the

  the J-PLUS filters. The colour gradient moves towards larger $E_{B-V}$
  values, from light yellow to dark blue.}
  \label{Fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Exclusion of contaminants}
The data publicly available from Gaia\,DR3 are useful to identify Galactic 
stars in the photometric catalogue. This is particularly helpful for
points sources brighter than $g=20.5$\,mag, for which more than 50 
per-cent have proper motion measurements ($\mu$, and 90 per-cent if the 
threshold is set at $g=19$\,mag). In \citet{chi22}, the criterion was to 
reject all the sources with $\mu > 3.6\,{\rm mas\,yr^{-1}}$, based on 
the proper motion measurements of confirmed GCs from the literature. In 
Fig.\,\ref{Fig3} the proper motion measurements for confirmed GCs of M\,81 
from the literature, and three times their corresponding uncertainties
are shown . It is noticeable that, although many GCs present non-negligible 
proper motions, the vast majority of them do not surpass the 
$3\cdot \sigma$ value. A few GCs from \citet{per95} exceed this limit, 
but they lack ACS photometry confirming their extended nature, and 
their flux excess from Gaia (i.e., the ratio between the fluxes derived from
the spectra of the object and its point-spread function in the astrometric CCD) 
range $1.15-1.25$, which is expected for 
point sources. Hence, our rejection criterion is $\mu > 3\cdot \sigma_{\mu}$.

Finally, radial velocities from SDSS\,DR16 \citep{ahu20} are included,
discarding those objects with heliocentric velocities $>1000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, 
based on the heliocentric velocities of the galaxies of the triplet.
The resulting catalogue has $\approx 11,900$ objects.

  uncertainties, for confirmed GCs of M\,81. The red line represents the
  identity relation.}

\section{Conclusion}
 A better segregation of point-like sources in our photometry, plus more a restrictive
 criterion for proper motion measurements, produce a final catalogue with fewer 
 contaminants. Although it is limited to bright sources, the spectroscopic survey 
 from SDSS\,DR16 is also helpful for this goal. This procedure is intended to provide
 an improved input catalogue for statistical methods, as the one applied in \citet{chi22},
 leading to a better selection of GC candidates.
