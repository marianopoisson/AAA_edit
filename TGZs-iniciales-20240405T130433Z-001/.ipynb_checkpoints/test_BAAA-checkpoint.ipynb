This theory is used to explain the presence of long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies \\\\citep{dyntheo}. In stars, the conductive fluid is the ionized gas in the convective zone and at the tachocline, which is the transition region between the radiative and convective zones.\\n',\n",

       " 'M dwarfs are low-mass late-type main sequence stars, which are the most common type of stars in the galaxy \\\\citep{comunes}, and which often show significant magnetic activity \\\\citep{mfmd}. The stellar mass determines the structure of M dwarfs which range from 0.08 to 0.55 $M_{\\\\odot}$. If the M dwarf has a mass greater than 0.35 $M_{\\\\odot}$, the star is partially convective, which means that it has a radiative core and a convective envelope. If the stellar mass is less than 0.35 $M_{\\\\odot}$, the star is fully convective \\\\citep{estructure}.\\n',\n",

       " 'Several models have been developed to study stellar dynamos, some of which consider fully convective stars. Most of these simulations operate in spherical shells, (e.g., \\\\citealt{brown}; \\\\citealt{paper2016}). Another option is to use the star-in-a-box model (e.g., \\\\citealt{caroo}; \\\\citealt{model}). Whereas other works model partially convective stars, such as sun-like stars (e.g., \\\\citealt{Felipe1, Felipe2}). \\\\cite{petriSL} applied a star-in-a-box model to solar-like stars in a recent study. Our goal is to apply the star-in-a-box setup for partially convective M dwarfs to study the behavior of the magnetic fields within the star. In \\\\cite{petriSL}, different rotation rates were used and it was noted that while the exact excitation mechanism of the dynamos in the current simulations is not yet clear, it was shown that the including a radiative core and regions exterior to the star are important in shaping the dynamo. \\n',\n",

       " 'As a consequence, in this work we present 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of partially convective M dwarf stars at different rotations rates, where we changed the magnetic boundary conditions in the exterior of the star to study how this affects the dynamo. First, we present the computational methods used with a brief description of the model and the stellar parameters in section \\\\ref{S_model} and then we show the preliminary results in section \\\\ref{S_results}.

This is most clearly seen in the case where a larger diffusivity is applied in the exterior of the star (runs B3 and C4) in which cases the cyclic solutions disappear. This can be understood as a lower excitation threshold for quasi-static solution in this geometry. It less clear why the dynamo in Run C1 operates only intermittently. A possibility is that the dynamo is only weakly supercritical for this combination of $\\\\Omega$ and constant diffusivity. A more through analysis in terms of mean-field dynamo theory is needed to ascertain the precises causes for the changing behavior.\\n',\n",

Run C1, even with irregular activity, shows that the magnetic field changes polarity, but no cyclicity is observed.
