\section{Introduction}\label{S_intro}

The formation of a high-mass star begins with the fragmentation of a massive clump into smaller structures known as molecular cores. There are two models under debate for high-mass star formation: monolithic collapse \citep{palau2018, moscadelli2021} and competitive accretion \citep{motte18, sch19}.
For the study and validation of these models, it is essential to determine the masses of the cores involved in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. For this, the correct estimation of the temperature of the molecular cores is of crucial importance since it is directly related to the calculation of their masses.

One of the most used tools in temperature estimation is the Rotational Diagram \citep{goldsmith99} applied to top-symmetric molecules. In particular, the top-symmetric molecule methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is a good temperature tracer. CH$_3$CN is formed in interstellar grains by recombination of radicals such as CN- and CH$_3$- \citep{her14} and it is generally detected in hot molecular cores \citep{brouillet2022}. In this work, we present preliminary results of a statistical study of the CH$_3$CN molecule as a temperature tracer toward a sample of high-mass molecular clumps with cores in its interior.

\section{Data}

Data cubes were obtained from the ALMA Science Archive. We used data from the project 2015.1.01312.S (P.I. Gary Fuller). The telescope configuration used baselines  L5BL/L80BL of 39.84/215.91m, respectively,  in the 12\,m array. 
The observed frequency range of the spectral window used in this work goes from 238.81 to 240.69~GHz (Band 6). The angular and spectral resolutions are 0$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$7 and 1.4~MHz, respectively. The velocity resolution is about 1.4~km~s$^{-1}$. The rms noise level is 4.2~mJy~beam$^{-1}$ for the emission line (averaged each 10~km s$^{-1}$) and 0.14~mJy~beam$^{-1}$ for the continuum emission. The maximum recoverable spatial scale is 6$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$53.

\section{Results}

Using data from the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL; \citealt{atla}), we studied 19 sources representing condensations of cold dust (molecular clumps) of a few (between 2 to 10) parsecs in size. For each molecular clump, we analyze the 1.2~mm continuum emission to identify possible fragmentation. The typical size of these fragments (molecular cores) is on the order of the subparsec. 
Figure\,\ref{Figura1} displays the continuum emission from the ALMA data toward each analyzed source. The spectrum of each core was inspected to detect the presence or not of CH$_3$CN emission, and in the case of a positive detection, we calculated the temperatures of the core.

In Table\,\ref{datos}, we present the  main physical parameters of the studied ATLASGAL sources (Cols. 1 to 6). The systemic velocity (V$_\mathrm{LSR}$) of most of the sources were obtained from \citet{wienen2015},  while for those sources not studied in that work, the systemic velocity was estimated using the intense and ubiquitous transition J=5$-$4 of the methanol at 239.746~GHz. For these last sources, the kinematic distances were obtained using the Galactic rotation model of \citet{brand93} based on their estimated systemic velocities.

The study of the possible fragmentation of each ATLASGAL clump in multiple molecular cores was carried out by analyzing the high resolution and sensitivity ALMA continuum  emission at 1.2~mm (see Fig.\,\ref{Figura1}). From a careful inspection of the spectrum toward each core, we determined the presence or not of methyl cyanide emission. For the purposes of this work, active cores (labeled as C\# in Fig.\,\ref{Figura1}) are defined as those that exhibit CH$_3$CN emission strong enough to allow us for a reliable estimation of the core temperature. Therefore, it is possible that a source is fragmented into several cores, but only some of them are active cores as defined here. If the clump is fragmented, the number of active cores within it is indicated in Cols.\,3 and 4 of Table\,\ref{datos}.

\subsection{Rotational diagrams and rotational temperature.}

The primary objective of this work is to conduct a statistical study of the CH$_3$CN molecule as a chemical thermometer for hot molecular cores. To achieve this, we first estimate the rotational temperature (T$_\mathrm{rot}$) of each active core using the CH$_3$CN emission through the rotational diagram method. Under the assumption of LTE conditions and that the lines are optically thin, with a beam filling factor equal to unity, we derive the T$_\mathrm{rot}$ for each core. This analysis is based on a derivation of the Boltzmann equation:\\

\begin{equation}
        {\rm ln}\left (\frac{N_u}{g_u}  \right ) = {\rm ln}\left ( \frac{N_\mathrm{tot}}{Q_\mathrm{rot}} \right )-\frac{E_u}{kT_\mathrm{rot}},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_u$ represents the molecular column density of the upper level of the transition, $g_u$ the total degeneracy of the upper level, $E_u$ the energy of the upper level, N$_\mathrm{tot}$ the total column density of the molecule, $Q_\mathrm{rot}$ the rotational partition function, and $k$ the Boltzmann constant.

Following \citet{miao95}, for interferometric observations, the left-hand side of Eq. 1 can also be estimated by,\\

\begin{equation}
{\rm ln}\left (\frac{N_u^{obs}}{g_u}  \right ) = {\rm ln}\left ( \frac{2.04\times10^{20}\,W}{\theta_a \theta_b\,g_kg_l\nu_0^{3}\,S_{ul} \mu_0^{2} } \right ),
\end{equation}


\noindent where $N_u^{obs}$ (in $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) is the observed column density of the molecule under the conditions mentioned above, $\mathrm{\theta_a}$ and $\mathrm{\theta_b}$ (in arcsec) are the major and minor axes of the clean beam, respectively, $W$ (in Jy beam$^{-1}$ km s$^{-1}$) is the integrated intensity of each K-projection, $g_k$ is the K-ladder degeneracy, $g_l$ is the degeneracy due to the nuclear spin, $\nu_0$ (in GHz) is the rest frequency of the transition, $S_{ul}$ is the line strength of the transition, and $\mu_0$ (in Debye) is the permanent dipole moment of the molecule. The free parameters, ($N_\mathrm{tot}/Q_\mathrm{rot}$) and T$_\mathrm{rot}$ (see Table\,\ref{datos}) were determined by a linear fitting of Eq.\,1. The typical errors in T$_\mathrm{rot}$ are about 10\%.\\


\subsection{Correlation between CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$CCH}

Methyl Acetylene (CH$_3$CCH) is also a top-symmetric molecule that can serve as a good temperature indicator. CH$_3$CCH is probably produced in interstellar ices by radical combination and by successive hydrogenation of physisorbed C$_3$ \citep{kalenskii,hickson16, wong18}.

However, as different authors pointed out (e.g., \citealt{tycho2021}), CH$_3$CN would trace more internal regions of the core, because this molecule requires  higher temperatures to be sublimated from the surface of the dust grains, while the emission of CH$_3$CCH is preferentially found mapping the coldest envelopes. Interestingly, the transitions of CH$_3$CN (J=13-12) and CH$_3$CCH (14-13), which exhibit a K-ladder form,  are very close in frequency in the ALMA Band 6 (see Fig. \ref{Figura2}), which allow us to simultaneously characterize both emissions in the context of our statistical study of chemical thermometers.

Cores with T$_\mathrm{rot}$ $>$ 350 K or cores that presented atypically high values of R were not taken into account (outlier points). The linear fitting obtained is $R=0.016\, \mathrm{T_{rot}} - 1.1$}
\label{Figura3}
\end{figure}

The possible correlation between the ratio of the peak intensities of CH$_{3}$CN and CH$_{3}$CCH ($R$=I$_{\rm CH_3CN}$/I$_{\rm CH_3CCH}$) and the temperature of the cores was studied. We used the K=2 projection for both molecules because it is an intense component not blended with others lines, and thus it can be used to reliably determine its peak intensity, in this way we limit the error of $R$ to 5\%.
Figure\,\ref{Figura3} shows the linear fitting between $R$ and the rotational temperature of the cores. The fitting was carried out on cores with temperatures lower than 350 K. This cutoff is attributed to the high dispersion observed in the ratios above such a temperature, an issue that will be studied in a future work.
% limit will be reviewed in the final work since there are several studies where higher temperatures are obtained using the rotational diagram method. {\bf Esto tenemos que discutirlo un toque}

Some cores present an atypical behavior in $R$ and were not considered for the fitting. These atypical points (outlier points) will also be studied individually in a future work, seeking to determine their evolutionary stages and the reason for their discrepancy with the most common cases.

Taking into account the limitations previously stated, we performed a linear fit on the data, obtaining a relationship of $R=0.016\, \mathrm{T_{rot}}-1.1$, with a $\rho^2$ (Pearson's correlation coefficient) around 0.7. Figure\,\ref{Figura3} shows a clear linear correlation between $R$ and the temperature of the cores, which suggests that the ratio $R$ could be useful,  under certain conditions, to estimate the temperature of a core in a simpler way than using the rotational diagram method.

\section{Summary}

%\textcolor{red}{ACA NO PONDRIA UN SUMMARY, ES UN ARTICULO CORTO QUE NO REQUIERE HACER UN RESUMEN DE LO HECHO. SACARIA EL SUMMARY Y LOS DETALLES DE COMO SE HICIERON LAS COSAS. EN UN PAR DE ORACIONES DEJARIA DICHO LA UTILIDAD DE LO QUE SE HIZO Y LO QUE SE VA HACER.}


We characterized 19 ATLASGAL sources/clumps using high resolution and sensitivity ALMA data in Band 6. The continuum emission at 1.2~mm revealed fragmentation in most of the clumps. We classified 24 molecular cores as active.

We estimated the cores temperatures using the rotational diagram method applied to the emission of the CH$_3$CN. In addition, we built the ratio $R$=I$_{\rm CH_3CN}$/I$_{\rm CH_3CCH}$ (K=2) as a first exploration of the study of the CH$_3$CN  and CH$_3$CCH molecules as a chemical thermometer for the active cores. We found a linear correlation between the ratio $R$ and the rotational temperature of the cores in the range of temperatures going from 50 to 350~K. Active cores whose rotational temperature exceeds 350 K and those that present $R$ values that deviate from the behavior of the majority are not considered for the linear fitting. These cores were called `outlier points' and the interpretation of what is occurring with such cores will be studied in a future work. The open and important question that arises from this study is what are the underlying factors contributing to the observed linear correlation between $R$ and the rotational temperature, as well as its dependence on the evolutionary stage of the source, are yet to be determined.

%In the future, it is expected to search for other relationships of CH$_3$CN with other spectral lines or other physical magnitudes that support its functioning as a thermometer.

Finally, once we are able to determine the accuracy in the calculation of the temperature through these methods, we will estimate the active core masses in the context of the two main models of massive star formation.
