\resumen{Las enanas M son estrellas de baja masa de la secuencia principal, el tipo de estrella más común de la galaxia. Es bien sabido que tienen una importante actividad magnética, pero el mecanismo que la controla aún no está claro. Las enanas M con masas mayores a 0.35 $M_{\odot}$ son parcialmente convectivas, y esta transición marca un importante cambio en la estructura estelar que puede afectar a la producción y almacenamiento de campos magnéticos internos. El objetivo de este trabajo es probar un nuevo modelo computacional para la dínamo de enanas M parcialmente convectivas. Este modelo consiste en simulaciones numéricas magnetohidrodinámicas tridimensionales utilizando el modelo de estrella en una caja, donde consideramos una estrella de radio $R$ en un cubo cartesiano de tamaño $(2.2 R)^3$. Dentro de este modelo, cambiamos las condiciones magnéticas de contorno para estudiar cómo esto puede afectar a la dínamo; además se exploraron diferentes velocidades de rotación.}

\abstract{M dwarfs are low-mass main-sequence stars, which are the most common type of star in the galaxy. It is well know that they have significant magnetic activity but the mechanism that controls is still unclear. M dwarfs more massive than $0.35 \;M_{\odot}$ are partially convective and this transition marks an important change in the stellar structure that can affect the production and storage of internal magnetic fields. The aim of this work is to test a new computational model for the dynamos of partially convective M dwarfs. This model consists of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations using a star-in-a-box model, where we consider a star of radius $R$ in a Cartesian cube of size $(2.2 R)^3$. Within this model, we change the magnetic boundary conditions to see how this affects the dynamo and also explore different rotation rates.}

%Up to now, we observe clear cycles in three of our simulations with different rotation rates, while the others have dynamos that are quasi-static. In addition, we present an exceptional case where the magnetic field disappears and reappears.%

\section{Introduction}\label{S_intro}


Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid generate and maintain a magnetic field. This theory is used to explain the presence of long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies \citep{dyntheo}. In stars, the conductive fluid is the ionized gas in the convective zone and at the tachocline, which is the transition region between the radiative and convective zones.

M dwarfs are low-mass late-type main sequence stars, which are the most common type of stars in the galaxy \citep{comunes}, and which often show significant magnetic activity \citep{mfmd}. The stellar mass determines the structure of M dwarfs which range from 0.08 to 0.55 $M_{\odot}$. If the M dwarf has a mass greater than 0.35 $M_{\odot}$, the star is partially convective, which means that it has a radiative core and a convective envelope. If the stellar mass is less than 0.35 $M_{\odot}$, the star is fully convective \citep{estructure}.

Several models have been developed to study stellar dynamos, some of which consider fully convective stars. Most of these simulations operate in spherical shells, (e.g., \citealt{brown}; \citealt{paper2016}). Another option is to use the star-in-a-box model (e.g., \citealt{caroo}; \citealt{model}). Whereas other works model partially convective stars, such as sun-like stars (e.g., \citealt{Felipe1, Felipe2}). \cite{petriSL} applied a star-in-a-box model to solar-like stars in a recent study. Our goal is to apply the star-in-a-box setup for partially convective M dwarfs to study the behavior of the magnetic fields within the star. In \cite{petriSL}, different rotation rates were used and it was noted that while the exact excitation mechanism of the dynamos in the current simulations is not yet clear, it was shown that the including a radiative core and regions exterior to the star are important in shaping the dynamo. 

As a consequence, in this work we present 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of partially convective M dwarf stars at different rotations rates, where we changed the magnetic boundary conditions in the exterior of the star to study how this affects the dynamo. First, we present the computational methods used with a brief description of the model and the stellar parameters in section \ref{S_model} and then we show the preliminary results in section \ref{S_results}. We finish with the conclusions and future work in section \ref{final}.

\section{Computational methods}\label{S_model}
\subsection{The Pencil Code}
 
The simulations were run with the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{\url{{https://pencil-code.org/}}} \citep{pencil} which is a high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamics with magnetic fields. The code can solve both ordinary and partial differential equations, and it is easily adapted to different types of problems by activating or deactivating the different modules as needed. The code uses parallel domain decomposition and MPI.

\subsection{The Model}
The star-in-a-box model is described in \cite{model}, and is based on the set-up of \cite{dobler}. We consider a sphere of radius $R$ that is enclosed in a Cartesian cube with side $H = 2.2\; R$ where all coordinates $(x, y, z)$ range from $- H/2$ to $H/2$. The equations to solve are the induction, continuity, momentum, and energy conservation equations, given respectively by

where $K$ corresponds to Kramers opacity law, $\chi_{\textrm{SGS}}$ is the SGS diffusion coefficient, $s' = s - \Bar{s}_t $ is the entropy fluctuation and $\Bar{s}_t$ is a running temporal mean of the entropy.

\subsection{Stellar parameters}

Due to the fully compressible formulation of the MHD equations, we use a much higher luminosity than in the target star to avoid the time step being limited by sound waves and to resolve the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. Therefore, the results must be scaled to represent them in physical units; see \cite{unifis}. 

For the conversion to physical units we need the parameters of a reference star. In this case we use a star simulated with the stellar evolution code MESA \citep{MESA} with its online version MESA web\footnote{\url{http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit}}. In particular, we simulate a star of $M_{\star} = 0.75 ~  M_{\odot}$, $R_{\star} = 0.72~  R_{\odot}$, $L = 0.94~  L_{\odot}$ and $\rho_{c}^{\star} = 1.08\times 10^{5}~ \rm kg\; m^{-3}$. Following the description in Appendix A of \cite{unifis} we calculate the dimensionless luminosity. In the current simulation we have $\mathcal{L} = 5.8\times10^{-5}$ and the value from the target star is $\mathcal{L}_{\star} = 1.36\times 10^{-12}$. Thus, the velocities are enhanced by a factor $L_{\rm ratio}^{1/3} \approx 350$, where $L_{\rm ratio}=\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}_{\star} \approx 4.3\times 10^{7}$.

The surface gravity of the star is 
\begin{equation*}
    g_{\star}= \frac{GM_{\star}}{R_{\star}^2} = \frac{0.75}{(0.72)^2} \frac{G M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}^{2}} \approx 1.45~ g_{\odot} \approx 396~ {\rm m\,s^{-2}},
\end{equation*}
where $g_{\odot} = 274~ \rm {m\,s^{-2}}$. For the rotation rate conversion factor we have
\begin{equation*}
    \Omega^{\rm sim} = L_{\rm ratio}^{1/3} \left(\frac{g^{\rm sim}}{g_{\star}} \frac{R_{\star}}{R^{\rm sim}}\right)^{1/2} \Omega_{\star},
\end{equation*}
using the solar rotation rate $\Omega_{\star} = \Omega_{\odot} = 2.7\times 10^{-6}~ \rm s^{-1}$, yields
\begin{equation*}
    \Omega^{\rm sim} = 1.062~ \left(\frac{g^{\rm sim}}{R^{\rm sim}}\right)^{1/2},
\end{equation*}
where $g^{\rm sim} = g^{\rm sim}(r=R)\approx 1$ and $R^{\rm sim}=1$ in simulation units. After substitution and conversion to physical units (Mm, yr, and kG), we get conversions factors
\begin{align}
    x~ [\rm Mm] &\approx 500~ x^{\rm sim}~ [\rm sim. units], \\
    t~ [\rm yr] &\approx 0.0125~ t^{\rm sim}~ [\rm sim. units], \\
    U~ [\rm m\,s^{-1}] &\approx 1271.2~U^{\rm sim}~ [\rm sim. units], \\
    B~ [\rm kG] &\approx 4691~ B^{\rm sim}~ [\rm sim.units].
\end{align}

\subsection{Simulation Parameters}

The opacity of the medium is described by Kramers opacity law \citep{kramerley}. We choose the value of the opacity so that we have a radiative core and a convective envelope. We use different $\Omega$ for sets B, C, D and E, and three different setups are explored: in the first one (B1, C1, C5) $\nu = \eta$, in the second one (B2, C2, C3, D1, E1) diffusivity profiles are added inside of the star, and in the third one (B3, C4) the diffusivity profiles are added both inside and outside the star; see Table \ref{tabla} for values.
%When we add a diffusivity profile we need to increase the resolution of the simulation to be able to see the result. This is because we us

%PJK
smaller values of $\eta$ and $\nu$ at the center of the star, which are $5\times 10^{-7}$ and $2.5\times 10^{-7}$ respectively. In the second case, we decreased the value of $\eta$ and $\nu$ (mentioned above) by a factor $10^{2}$ below the tachocline, which is situated at about $r = 0.6 R$ (first jump). For the third case, we consider the jump inside the star mentioned before, and add a second jump in the $\eta$ parameter, by a factor $10^{3}$ respect to the core value, outside of the star, i.e., $R > 1.0$. 
%PJK: added for the referee
The standard case with ${\rm Pr}_{\rm M} =1$ is chosen because it is numerically the most convenient. The justification to lower the diffusivity in the core is to slow down the diffusion of flows and magnetic fields from the convection zone to the core. Similarly the profile exterior to the star prevents too rapid diffusion and effectively changes the boundary condition of the magnetic field at the surface of the star.
%PJK


\subsection{Dimensionless numbers}

Table \ref{tabla} shows the values of different dimensionless numbers which help us to characterize each of the simulations. Here the quantities are evaluated in the convective zone of the star, so the scale of the largest convective eddies is given by $k_R = 2\pi/0.4R$.

The Coriolis number is a measure of the influence rotation on the flow
\begin{equation}
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;{\rm Co} = \frac{2\Omega_0}{u_{\rm rms} k_{R}},
\end{equation}
where $u_{\rm rms}$ is the volume-averaged root-mean-square velocity. The fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers are defined as

\begin{equation}
   \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;{\rm Re} = \frac{u_{\rm rms}}{\nu k_{R}}, \; {\rm Re_{\rm M}} = \frac{u_{\rm rms}}{\eta k_{R}}.
\end{equation}
The SGS Prandtl and magnetic Prandtl number are given by
\begin{equation}
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;{\rm Pr_{SGS}} = \frac{\nu}{\chi_{\rm SGS}}, \; {\rm Pr_{\rm M}} = \frac{\nu}{\eta}.
\end{equation}
%We must take into account that the values of ${\rm Re_{\rm M}}$ and $\rm Pr_{\rm M}$ are for the interior of the star. For the cases with different value of $\eta$ in the exterior we must consider two values, one in the inside and the other in the outside of the star.
%PJK: shorten
We note that the values of ${\rm Re_{\rm M}}$ and $\rm Pr_{\rm M}$ are given for the interior of the star. For the cases with different $\eta$ in the exterior we consider two values, one in the inside and the other in the outside of the star.
%PJK: added from the response to referee
As in all numerical simulations of stellar convection the Prandtl is much larger and Reynolds numbers much smaller than in reality. The only effect that can be accurately modeled is the rotational influence measured by the Coriolis number; see, e.g. \cite{2023SSRv..219...58K}.

\section{Preliminary results}\label{S_results}

%PJK: using \overline instead of \bar looks better
Figure \ref{pbfly} shows the evolution of the azimuthally averaged magnetic field $\overline{B}_{\phi}$ at the surface of the star as a function of time for the simulations of sets B and C. 
%PJK: reformulated
We choose simulations with each of our three setups: no diffusivity profiles, profile in the core, and profile in the core and exterior.
%{\bf For set} C we choose the runs C1, C3 and C4. Here we see the effect of the magnetic boundary conditions. We can notice that in the upper panel of the Fig. \ref{pbfly} (set B), B1, B2 and B3 have different solutions. 
%PJK: moved lower and reformulated
%In terms of the minimum and maximum magnetic field, we have values of $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-36.1, 32.4)~ \rm kG$ for B1, $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-47.8, 32.3)~ \rm kG$ for B2 and $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-30.5, 20.5)~ \rm kG$ for B3. 
%PJK: I think that the maxima are not so important here
%PJK: moved from above and expanded
The upper panel of the Fig.~\ref{pbfly} shows the results for runs B1, B2, and B3.
%Run B1 has more concentrated magnetic field near the equator which show some polarity changes, and appears to be quasi-static at the poles.
%PJK: reformulated
Run B1 with no diffusivity profiles has more cyclic fields near the equator toward the end of the simulation.
%In B2, for which we add a jump inside of the star, we see near to the equator a quasi-static pattern, some reversals on top of and a quasi-static magnetic fields at the poles. 
%PJK: shortened
In B2, for with a diffusivity jump inside the star, we see a quasi-static unipolar field superimposed with a cyclic pattern near the equator.
%In the B3, where we add the jump inside and outside the star, we do not see any cycles or change in the polarity. 
%PJK:
In run B3, with diffusivity jumps inside and outside the star, the cycles disappear. 
%PJK: combine paragraphs
%For the lower panel of the Fig. \ref{pbfly} (set C), in terms of the minimum and maximum magnetic field, we have values of $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-27.8, 28.8)~ \rm kG$ for C1, $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-36.2, 36.1)~ \rm kG$ for C3 and $(\Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm min}, \Bar{B}_{\phi}^{\rm max}) = (-20.8, 22.0)~ \rm kG$ for C4. 
%PJK: the maxima are not so important here
%In C1, the dynamo seems to be less regular with sporadic activity, and concentration near to the equator. 
%PJK: reworded
In run C1, the dynamo is irregular and concentrated near the equator with sporadic activity with long quiescent periods.
 In run C3 we see regular cycles near the equator with a period about $P_{\rm cyc} = 21.7 ~ \rm [yr]$. Finally, run C4 has a quasi-static dynamo concentrated in the northern hemisphere.

%If we compare the sets with each other, we can notice some similarities depending on the boundary condition being used. 
%PJK: horten
Comparing the sets of runs, we notice similarities depending on the boundary conditions used. 
%B2 and C3 (with one jump) have a similar structure to that of the Solar butterfly diagram, whereas C3 has the most regular cycles and the clearest changes in the polarity of the dynamo. 
%PJK: shorten and reworded
 Runs B2 and C3 (with one jump) show similarity with the solar butterfly diagram, with C3 having the most regular cycles.
On the other hand, runs B3 and C4 (with two jumps) have quasi-static dynamos, without polarity changes.
%PJK: speculating a little about the differences
A plausible reason for the differences in the dynamos depending on the diffusivity profiles is that if magnetic fields cannot penetrate (or they need more time to do so) the core and the exterior, the possible dynamo modes that can be excited will also be different from the case where uniform diffusion is used. This is most clearly seen in the case where a larger diffusivity is applied in the exterior of the star (runs B3 and C4) in which cases the cyclic solutions disappear. This can be understood as a lower excitation threshold for quasi-static solution in this geometry. It less clear why the dynamo in Run C1 operates only intermittently. A possibility is that the dynamo is only weakly supercritical for this combination of $\Omega$ and constant diffusivity. A more through analysis in terms of mean-field dynamo theory is needed to ascertain the precises causes for the changing behavior.

%As for the cycles, we can observe that only simulation C3 has the most defined cycles compared to the other simulations (B1, B2, B3, C1, C4), of which B1 seems to have cycles at the end of the run and B2 seems to have cycles at the beginning of the run but in a more irregular way. Run C1, even with irregular activity, shows that the magnetic field changes polarity, but no cyclicity is observed. However, to be sure that these three runs (B1, B2, C1) do not have cycles, we should run these simulations for a longer time. 
%PJK: Condensed to this
 We observe clear cycles only in runs C3 and toward the end of run B1. Longer time series is needed to ascertain this and whether the cycles in run B2 continue to fade away or whether they are robust. These issues will be revisited in a future study.

%Finally in runs B3 and C4 we do not see any cycles since they have a quasi-static dynamo.
%PJK: this is already clear from the figure

\section{Summary and future work}\label{final}

It is clear that changing the conditions in the interior or exterior of the star, the large-sclae magnetic field is affected. In particular, enhancing the diffusivity exterior to the star leads to the disappearance of cyclic solutions.
%PJK: added
This is most likely due to different excitation conditions of cyclic and stationary dynamos depending on the spatial distribution of the diffusion coefficients.

%PJK: added future work explicitly
 In future work these results can be compared with the simulations of \cite{caroo}, who studied fully convective M dwarfs with the same model. This can be useful to explore what happens in the transition from fully convective to partially convective M dwarfs.
%PJK: combine paras
As we already know the parameter regime where we obtain a dynamo, we will complete the set D and E with a simulation where the exterior magnetic boundary condition changes, and add another set (A) similar to sets D and E but with an $\Omega = 0.5$ to study how the magnetic field behaves over a considerable range of rotation rates.
%PJK: added this
These simulations will be used to study the relation between stellar rotation and cycles.
