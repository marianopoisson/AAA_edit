%Inflationary models emerge within the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) as an explanation to the homogeneity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the flatness of the Universe, and the non-abundance of magnetic monopoles. The detection of primordial gravitational waves through the B-mode polarization of the CMB could be interpreted as the first indirect measurement of the cosmic inflationary period. However, this detection is challenging due to several factors, including galactic foregroundv contamination, weak gravitational lensing, and instrumental noise. In this work, we focus on developing a method to remove galactic contaminants from polarization maps obtained by a CMB-S4–like telescope, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The use of CNNs arises as an alternative to traditional foreground removal methods, which typically require strong assumptions about the properties of these contaminants. In our study, we employ high-resolution maps to construct a lensing template, which is then applied to low-resolution maps with the goal of detecting the recombination bump at the multipole scale $\ell \approx 200$. Our simulations include the lensing effect on the primordial spectra, galactic foreground, and instrumental noise. In this work, we demonstrate that this technique effectively removes contaminants from high-resolution maps, resulting in a relative error of less than 10\% for the B-mode power spectrum and below 1\% for the E-mode spectrum. Additionally, we investigate its impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio



%Despite this success, there remain some unexplained phenomena, such as the flatness and homogeneity of the Universe. To account for these the most widespread proposed solution are inflation models. The detection of the B-mode polarizarion of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) could be interpreted as the first indirect measurement of the cosmic inflationary period


% convolutional neural network was developed for the task of pulse counting in particle detectors for high energy physics. For the extraction of signal parameters was used a network with convolutional autoencoder architecture and a subsequent result reconstruction algorithm was developed and applied


\abstract{
 The standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) has gained solid ground in the past decades by correctly and consistently predicting a wide range of observations. However, there are aspects that are still unknown, such as the mechanism to produce the initial perturbations that give rise to the cosmic structure. If those were produced during inflation, a period of exponential expansion at the very beginning of the Universe, then this would leave a particular polarization pattern in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), named B-modes. Many of the experiments aiming to measure this or other such faint signals make use of bolometers, as is the case of the QUBIC observatory, located in the province of Salta, Argentina. In this work we propose a new method to deal with contaminants within the signal of a bolometer through the use of neural networks (NN), especially those effects caused by cosmic rays which produce a characteristic spike in the data streams.  A convolutional neural network was developed for the task of spike counting. While for the extraction of signal parameters was used a NN with convolutional autoencoder architecture. Both models were trained with one hundred thousand simulated signals accounting for the noise of the instrument. The results, though preliminary, are promising showing a good accuracy on both models.

% The standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) has gained solid ground in the past decades by correctly and consistently predicting a wide range of observations.

In this work we propose a new method to deal with contaminants within the signal of a bolometer, especially those caused by cosmic rays, through the use of neural networks. One hundred thousand signals were simulated, accounting for the noise of the instrument, to train two different models. The first one identifies the number of cosmic ray events, while the latter also estimates the time stamps and the amplitudes of these events. The results, though preliminary, are promising showing a good accuracy both models. %Additionally, the second model could also being implemented to identify in the signal \textit{flux jumps}, jumps in the signal due to the quantization of the magnetic flux of the SQUIDs used in QUBIC. 


%Many experiments designed to measure faint signals make use of bolometers. This is the case of the QUBIC observatory, located at Salta, Argentina, that aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) polarization. The detection of primordial gravitational waves through the B-mode polarization of the CMB could be interpreted as the first indirect measurement of the cosmic inflationary period. These kinds of detectors are really sensitive to the impact of secondary particles from Cosmic Rays's showers. On this work we proposed a new method to deal with these kinds of contaminants in the data streams by incorporating a neural networks. Two models were applied, the first  model to identify, and later on remove them from the original signal. The same model can be applied to identify \textit{flux jumps}, a significative problem in the data of QUBIC. We obtained promising results by being able to correctly identify the Cosmic Rays signals
